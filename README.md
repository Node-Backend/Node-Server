# Node-Server
Simple Server Using Just nodejs, built from scratch.
- Node.js is a runtime environment (a program that runs other programs), a platform used to execute JavaScript applications outside the browser
- Node is uaed to write server code, specifically web services that can communicate with clients using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format for data interchange.
- allow us to use JavaScript to write command line utilities, native programs that run on different operating systems, networking software, web services, web applications and more.

#### To write a simple web server with Node.js:

1. Use Node’s HTTP module to abstract away complex network-related operations.
2. Write the single request handler function that will handle all requests to the server.

#### To run the server

1. Navigate to the folder in a terminal/console window and type `node index.js` to execute your file. A message that reads “Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000” should be displayed and the server is now waiting for connections.

2. Open a browser and visit: http://localhost:5000; localhost and the ip address 127.0.0.1 point to the same thing: your local computer. The browser should show the message: “Hello World from Node Simple Sever, It's workinge”.
